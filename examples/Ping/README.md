# SmartIot Ping Example

📣 SmartIot Ping example.

This is a simple example for Ping: You can send a SmartIot 3.0 compatible ping-request to the controller and it
will answer with message 'pong'.
For seeing it is alive, the controller sends in loop 'hello' messages.

Use PlatformIO to build and deploy the example.
